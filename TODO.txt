TODO list for daisywheel project

-Add SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, and CAPSLOCK keys, along with any other toggles
-Implement better GUI
-Expand available keys


-Add mouse capability
 -Mouse currently functions in one-movement intervals, but has full mouse functionality.
 -Need to fix RY issue (see footnote)
 -Need to prevent other events from triggering mouse movement
 -Need to fix loop so mouse moves until button is released. Timer function an option?
 -Lag within mouse movement. May be caused by other issues, so those should be fixed first.

-Add settings menu
 -Mouse speed
 -Terminal font size(?)
 -Additional keys(Accents, etc)(?)

-Add threading capability to mouse code
 -Intended to solve mouse movement issues
 -Could also be used to make scrolling through menus easier
 -Remember to set any threads independent of the exit-capable thread as daemons


ISSUES:

-RY Issue
 -The right stick is sending out massive amounts of noise that's screwing with everything else
 (triggering get_gamepad() almost constantly which triggers things that shouldn't be triggered
 (See Mouse movement loop)). Is even triggered by the entire controller being rotated or slowly flipped over.

-Mouse movement loop
 -Currently, get_gamepad() always pauses the mouse movement loop. However, without get_gamepad(),
  there wouldn't be any updates to stop the loop at the proper time. Solution in other projects was
  to make a timer that called the movement function so long as a variable was true. This may be an option here.
 -Currently, any other event occuring while the movement button is held down will cause the cursor to continue until all
  events have been resolved. May be solved if an "if not foo: pass" statement is called within "for event in self.events".

-Mouse lag
 -Currently, the mouse movement is jerky and random when held down. RY and Loop issues may be the cause, and may be giving
  false information under other circumstances. Those two issues should be resolved before this one is inspected.
